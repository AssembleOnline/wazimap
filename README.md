Wazimap
=======

Wazimap is a Django application for exploring census and other similar data. It makes it easy to understand a place
through the eyes of the data, and to explore data across a range of places. It is most suited for census data
but can easily be used with other data that is similarly focused on places in a country.

Check out [Wazimap South Africa](http://wazimap.co.za>) and [Wazimap Kenya](http://kenya.wazimap.org>) to
get an idea of what Wazimap is about.

Wazimap is a fork of the excellent [Censusreporter](https://censusreporter.org>) project which was funded by a
[Knight News Challenge grant](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/knight-funding-expands-ires-journalist-friendly-census-site/>).
You can also find [Censusreporter on GitHub](https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter>).

Wazimap builds on Censusreporter and makes it easier to re-use. Wazimap was originally built by
[Code for South Africa](http://code4sa.org>) with the support of [Media Monitoring Africa](http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/>).
It is maintained by Code for South Africa.
